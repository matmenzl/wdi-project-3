# About
'7 Days of Sun' is a last minute travel and weather-report JavaScript Single Page Application which shows only sunny locations in the coming 7 days.   

'7 Days of Sun' was built as a group project during Web Development Immersive at General Assembly London.

### Problems
+ There's no travel-website and/or weather report which only returns you the sunny spots in a certain timeframe. Even though a hight percentage of travellers rather travel in sunny places than in rainy places. 

### Solution and how it works
+ '7 Days of Sun' shows you only sunny spots and allows you to book last minute flights
+ '7 Days of Sun' uses the JavaScript API from Google Maps to show the sunny locations. 
+ '7 Days of Sun' uses the forecast.io API in order to get the sunny spots within the coming 7 days.
+ '7 Days of Sun' uses a Skyscanner-Plugin in order to make last minute bookings. 
+ Users are able to register and login and can save their favourites in order to check at a later date if they are sunny.
+ '7 Days of Sun' offers a daily newsletter which sends you daily updates on sunny spots using Tinyletter.com.

### Technologies

+ JavaScript
